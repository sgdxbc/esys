Reproduce Evaluation of Real-world Deployment

On evaluation AWS account, enable evaluated regions and add a key pair called "Ephemeral"
* ap-east-1 (Hong Kong)
* ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
* us-west-1 (North California)
* eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
* sa-east-1 (Sao Paulo)
* af-south-1 (Cape Town)

Prepare control node
* Run Ubuntu 22.04 (because artifact will be compiled on control node and send to cluster nodes)
    * As user "ubuntu"
* Install Rust toolchain, C++ toolchain, CMake, Protocol Buffers toolchain, Terraform, Ansible, Jupyter Notebook, 
  Seaborn
* Set up AWS credential properly, so it has EC2 and VPC permissions
* Add this section to SSH config
```
Host *.compute.amazonaws.com
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    IdentityFile [path to "Ephemeral" key pair's PEM file]
```

Start evaluation
```
$ git submodule init
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform init
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform apply
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini crates/esys_entropy/playbook.yml
```

[Work in progress: pipe output CSV data into plot script]

Clean up
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook-shutdown.yml  # optional
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform destroy
```


Reproduce Evaluation of Simulation

Modify `crates/esys_simulate/src/main.rs` according to desired simulation configuration, then run
```
$ cargo run -r -q --bin esys_simulate > {prefix}-$(date +%s).csv
```

Plot the results with `notebooks` scripts. Each script picks up the data files whose prefix matches its own file name.
Since the result format is universal, all possible simulation configuration should be able to plot by all scripts, but
some combinations make more sense than the others.
