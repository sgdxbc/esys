Reproduce Evaluation of Real-world Deployment

On evaluation AWS account, enable evaluated regions and add a key pair called "Ephemeral"
* ap-east-1 (Hong Kong)
* ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
* us-west-1 (North California)
* eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
* sa-east-1 (Sao Paulo)
* af-south-1 (Cape Town)

Prepare control node
* Run Ubuntu 22.04 (because artifact will be compiled on control node and send to cluster nodes)
    * As user "ubuntu"
* Install Rust toolchain, C++ toolchain, CMake, Protocol Buffers toolchain, Terraform, Ansible
* Set up AWS credential properly, so it has EC2 and VPC permissions
* Add this section to SSH config
```
Host *.compute.amazonaws.com
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    IdentityFile [path to "Ephemeral" key pair's PEM file]
```

Start evaluation
```
$ git submodule init
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform apply
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini crates/esys_entropy/playbook.yml
```

Clean up
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook-shutdown.yml  # optional
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform destroy
```


Reproduce Evaluation of Simulation

```
$ cargo run -r -p esys_simulate
```
