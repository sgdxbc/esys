Reproduce Evaluation of Real-world Deployment

* On evaluation AWS account, enable evaluated regions and add a key pair called "Ephemeral"
    * ap-east-1 (Hong Kong)
    * ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
    * us-west-1 (North California)
    * eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
    * sa-east-1 (Sao Paulo)
    * af-south-1 (Cape Town)

* Configure control node to:
    * Run Ubuntu 22.04 (because artifact will be compiled on control node and send to cluster nodes)
    * Install Rust toolchain, Terraform, Ansible
    * Set up AWS credential properly, so it has EC2 and VPC permissions
    * Set up SSH to use the "Ephemeral" identity when host name matches wildcard `*.compute.amazonaws.com`

```
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform apply
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini crates/esys_entropy/playbook.yml
```

[Work in progress: evaluated data file location]

Clean up
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook-shutdown.yml # optional
$ terraform -chdir=crates/esys_entropy/terraform destroy
```


Reproduce Evaluation of Simulation

```
$ cargo run -r -p esys_simulated
```

[Work in progress: pipe output CSV data into plot script]
